This is my submission for the Google clone project on The Odin Project.

I've tried to learn front end before, so I have some prior knowledge, though not a lot. I've essentially had to relearn everything. The only thing I remembered from years ago, was the Doctype-declaration and the basic html skeleton.

I've also completed the two first projects of Free Code Camp's Responsive Web Design course. They're not impressive solutions, but they exist.

This README will be updated after project completion.
